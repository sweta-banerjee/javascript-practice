/** Print numbers from 1 -> 100 */
//1. Write a function called printNumber that takes an argument called number and prints it
//2. Write a function called generateNumbers which generates numbers 1 to 100 and  calls printNumber on each number
//3. Call generateNumbers function from outside

// function printNumber(number){
//     console.log(number+ "   is the number");

// }
// printNumber(13);

// function generateNumbers(num){
//     let count=1
//     while (count<= num){
//     printNumber(count);
//     count= count +2
//     }
// }
// generateNumbers(187);





//**Print Even Numbers between 1 to 100 */

// let count=2
// while (count<=100){
